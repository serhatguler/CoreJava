/*
            1)We create parent class and put common methods into the parent class to
                i)prevent repetition
                ii)make maintenance easy
                iii)make updates easy
                iv)save time in code typing
                v)make the classes as possible as small to make them work faster
            2)To make a class use methods from another class, we should create "parent-child relationship" between them.
              To create "parent-child relationship" we use "extends" keyword from "child class" to "parent class"
            3)"public" and "protected" methods can be inherited by "child classes" without any restriction.
              "default" methods can be inherited if the object and the parent class are in the same package.
              "private" methods cannot be inherited by child classes.
            4)If a child class uses class members from parent class it is called "inheritance"
            5)Object-Oriented Programming Concept has 4 Principles
                    a)Inheritance   b)Encapsulation   c)Polymorphism   d)Abstraction
            6)There are different types of Inheritance
                    i)Multiple Inheritance: Java does not support multiple inheritance
                                            Java supports "Single Inheritance"
                    ii)MultiLevel Inheritance:Java supports "multilevel inheritance"
                    iii)Hierarchical Inheritance: It is the combination of "multilevel inheritance" and "Single Inheritance"
