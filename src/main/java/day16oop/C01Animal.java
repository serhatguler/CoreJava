        1)The method in child class(Overriding Method) cannot have narrower
          access modifier than the method in parent class(Overridden Method)

          Overridden Method ==> default
          Overriding Method ==> default, protected, public

          Overridden Method ==> protected
          Overriding Method ==> protected, public

          Overridden Method ==> private
          Overriding Method ==> "private methods" cannot be overridden

        2)Polymorphism = Method Overloading(static polymorphism) + Method Overriding(dynamic polymorphism)

        3)What is the difference between "Method Overloading" and "Method Overriding"?
            i)"Method Overloading" occurs in a single class, "Method Overriding"
              needs multiple classes.
            ii)"Method Overriding" needs "inheritance", "Method Overloading" does not
            iii)"private" methods can be overloaded, but "private" methods cannot be
                overridden.
            iv) In "Method Overloading" we change "method signature", but in "Method Overriding"
               we do not change "method signature".
            v) In "Method Overloading" "access modifiers" and "return types" do not take any role,
               but in "Method Overriding" there are some rules to change "access modifiers" and "return types"
            vi)In "Method Overloading" we change the parameters and make the method work with different scenarios.
               In "Method Overriding" we make the method implementation more specific for the child class.
            vii)"static methods" can be overloaded, but cannot be overridden.
