/*
        Encapsulation: It means "data hiding"
        Why do you need to hide data?
        i) Because some data should not be public like "ID"
           "Credit Card Number", "SSN", etc.
        ii) Because we do not want some data to be accessible from the other classes.
        How do you do encapsulation?
        To hide data I use "private" access modifiers

        Note: set and get methods are called "Java Beans"
