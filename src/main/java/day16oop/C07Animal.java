        1)If a method has method body it is called "concrete method",
          if a method does not have method body it is called "abstract method".
        2)To make a method abstract
            i)Remove method body
            ii)Use "abstract" keyword between "access modifier" and "return type"
            iii)Make the class abstract as well
                because abstract methods can be put into abstract classes
        3)When you create an abstract,
          all the "concrete child classes" "must override" the abstract method
          But if parent class has "concrete methods", it is not mandatory to override.
